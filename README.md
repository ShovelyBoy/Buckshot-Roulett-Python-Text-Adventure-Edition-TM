BUCKSHOT ROULETT: PYTHON TEXT-ADVENTURE EDITIONâ„¢

Where I coded a "choose your own path" style of the popular game: "Buckshot Roulett", made by the legendary game producer; Mike Klubnika.

Q1: ...Why? 
  A:  fun little project I thought of to test my gathered skills in python and programming in general.

Q2: How similiar is it to the original?
  A: Besides the lack of graphics (totally a feature, not a bug), The game has rounds.


To run, open game.py in console.
